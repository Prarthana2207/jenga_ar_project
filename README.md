# jenga_ar_project
This project is an augmented reality (AR) application built using Three.js and WebXR, featuring dynamic light estimation, multiplayer interaction, and deployment on both Render and Vercel. The application displays modals in AR and includes robust support for devices that do not have light-estimation capabilities.
